          Our mission is to create a meaningful bridge between the world and the
          rich cultural heritage of Indian weddings. We believe that
          celebrations are the heart of Indian culture — filled with vibrant
          colors, music, traditions, rituals, spirituality, and the warmth of
          togetherness. But many international travelers only get to see these
          moments through screens or from a distance. We want to change that.
